/**
 * binary_tree_insert_left -  inserts a node as the left-child of another node
 *
 * @parent: it's a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
 * @value:  it's the value to store in the new node
 *
 * Description - If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its
 *		 place and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of
 *		 the new node.
 *
 * Return: Pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if
 *			parent is NULL
